# Python Things

A repository that contains python scripts that I've written with the purpose of automating various mundane tasks. A short description of each project is included below.  Each sub-directory contains its own README file that provides a more detailed explanation on how the script(s) work and how to use the script(s).

## List of scripts

### 00-renamer

A script that can be used to clean up the names of files and folders in a desired directory.  File and folders will be reformatted to contain all lower case letters, and use dashes in place of spaces. For example:`"this-is-a-clean-name"`. There is an option to enumerate file names starting at 00, for example `"00-enumerated-name"`
